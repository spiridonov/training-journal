Training journal
================

This is my calisthenics journal. Here are all my movements, reps, sets and my weight. And even some notes, personal records and injuries.

I always do 10-15 minutes full joints warmup before every training, so I avoid it in my journal. Just keep it in mind. And I also do additional warmup before any inversions (like handstand pushups) to avoid blood pressure issues: pike headstands, pike pushups, wrist warmup, headstands, handstands.

## Legend

It's easy to read:

* __Exercise__: __sets__ x __reps__, __sets__ x __reps__, ...
* Pistol squats: 3x5

When I occasionally use weights and do several sets, I write them like this:

* __Exercise__: __weight__ kg (__sets__ x __reps__, ...), ...
* Squats: 60kg 2x5, 80kg 4x10, 100kg 3x5

If there are several exercies in one row that means I perform them with no rest in between, like superset. For example:

* Thrusters 40kg + Pullups: 5x(7+7)
* Wide+Regular+Diamond pushups: 2x(10+10+10)
